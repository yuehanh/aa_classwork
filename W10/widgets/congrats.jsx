//React Components are [wrapper classes (new phrase)] for HTML code - "render() rules everything around me"
//Component can then be DOM-ed from the random .jsx format into JavaScript with the required function
//"Render is not bananable", they say
//A functional component is just a function? Ok It's functional programming logic

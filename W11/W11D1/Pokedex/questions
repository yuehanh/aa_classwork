1. how do setup the window.fetchallpokem etc...
2. Aside: configureStore Pattern
This is a great pattern to continue using - instead of just exporting the store, we are exporting a function that creates and returns a store. This can be used in the future to swap out reducers, preloadedState, or enhancers depending on different conditions (e.g. development vs production environments).
Doesnt this still require changing the code parametr in the store.js file
